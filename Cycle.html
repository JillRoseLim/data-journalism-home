<center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><font size ="5"><p style="line-height:45px">Two decades ago, biking to work made you an outlier. For bike activist <a href="http://dusp.mit.edu/projects-administrator/aaron-naparstek">Aaron Naparstek</a>, cycling to his midtown job in 1991 meant cab drivers hurled nasty curses, honked their horns and labeled him a weirdo. Today, the number of cyclists commuting to Manhattan has quintupled from 311 in 1995 to 1,356 in 2011-- a number that doesn't yet include those who cycle for other purposes. But despite the boom in bikers, data from the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) shows the number of cyclist fatalities has remained relatively the same-- suggesting a wider shift in how the city responds to cyclists.

<center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><font size ="5"><p style="line-height:45px">Along with more cyclists, the number of bike lanes and bike lane projects has boomed. There are now more than 500 bike lanes in New York City-- double the number in 2006 according to the DOT's <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/sustainable_streets_index_12.pdf">Sustainable Streets Index</a>. For public policy researcher Michael Smart, this reflects something entirely different from the first bicycle craze in the 1800s and another wave in the 70s. "This time around, the resulted not just in buying bikes, joining clubs or the bike becoming a symbol," says Smart. "It also resulted in people making changes to how streets are designed. In the 70s when bikes were sexy, we didn't replan our cities. We're doing that now, with cycle tracks, bike lanes and chevrons."</FONT></p></center>

</font></FONT></center>

<center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><font size ="5"><p style="line-height:45px">Smart says it's hard to know what prompted this bike craze, which exploded about ten years ago. Many things may have conspired, including bike advocacy groups like that of Aaron Naparstek or the movement to be more environmentally conscious. Nevertheless, the public's fascination with bikes kickstarted major changes in city transportation culture. In 2007, NYC DOT commissioner <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/nyregion/turning-the-citys-wheels-in-a-new-direction.html?_r=0">Janette Sadik-Khan</a> latched onto the craze and fueled the production of more bike lanes through the city. More bike lanes can decrease the perception of risk and prompt cautious cyclists to get out there. The presence of more cyclists may in turn increase cyclist safety with the phenomenon of safety in numbers. And as the number of cyclists multiply, it becomes increasingly harder for drivers not to sit up and pay attention. </FONT></p></center>
