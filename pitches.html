<h1> Data Visualization Project Pitches </h1>

<h3> 1. “It’s organic!”: the rise of the ‘Eat Clean’ Organic Movement, visualized </h3>

<p> The desire for organic foods, a healthy diet and a ‘clean’ lifestyle have no doubt gained popularity in the past decade. More quinoa, more yoga and more kale. But how can this trend be visualized or explained through an infographic? I’d like to focus on one aspect of the organic foods movement, which is the popularity of Whole Foods supermarkets (or possibly, Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s) over the last couple of years, and the number of Whole Foods being built across North America. I was inspired by the recent opening of a Whole Foods in my hometown, Toronto and the sudden popularity of it as the go-to place over other lunch places. Whole Foods has just announced its revenue continues to increase despite steep competition from other organic food outlets. </p> 

<p> One interesting issue this might investigate is the question of the cost of organic foods, and who can afford it. Some researchers have noted that Whole Foods builds stores only in the wealthiest cities/states in North America, while others show that this is actually changing to be less true over the years. In this sense, the infographic could address the question of do lower-income people have access to healthy food. </p>

<p> Data about Whole Foods is available from the company itself in the form of annual reports, and the popularity of Whole Foods stock is available from Google Finance. I would have to search for online surveys/statistics made by external sources… </p> 

<p> A human source could be a nutritionist well-versed in the trends of food consumption and sociology, such as one from the NYU Steinhardt Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health: http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/nutrition/faculty_bios/list/Faculty/Nutrition%2C_Food_Studies%2C_and_Public_Health </p>

<p> To do this project, I would have to learn how to create an interesting visual representation of the data that best shows the data without being too confusing. That means possibly learning to write codes for interactive pie charts, graphs, etc. A possible publication destination for the infographic could be an online news site like Quartz. </p>



<h3> 2. Examining depression treatments in America </h3>

<p> Antidepressant prescriptions have increased by 400% in the last decade according to reports from the IMS—it’s a statistic that’s sparked debate over whether doctors are over-prescribing without considering the side-effects (especially in children). There’s a growing demand to treat depression or depressive symptoms, and to do it fast. At the same time, cognitive behavioral therapy is gaining popularity as both an alternative and a treatment in combination with drugs. </p>

<p> I am interested in investigating the popularity of alternative behavioral treatment vs. the increase in anti-depressant prescription, particularly in the younger generation. How many children diagnosed with mental illness are using antidepressants and how many are trying alternative treatments? At what age are they beginning treatment? How does this compare to the overall percentage of adolescents with depression? This may not have a breaking-news news hook, but I think the debate over how to approach depression (I read this article a while ago) continues to be a hot topic in the mental health field. Despite more and more people demanding treatment, scientists are still in contention over what causes depression. This pressure and tension underlies the data. </p>

<p> Statistics on antidepressant use and alternative treatment therapy by age is available from The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (most comprehensive). Data on antidepressant prescriptions by age or year is available from IMS and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). IMS recently reported the top 100 selling drugs of 2013 (which might be an interesting visualization, in itself). A human source could be a depression expert from the CDC. </p>

<p> Once again, to do this project, I would still have to learn how to create an interesting visual representation of the data that best shows the data without being too confusing. That means possibly learning to write codes for interactive pie charts, graphs, etc. And I would also hope this sort of infographic could appear on Quartz. </p>


<h3> 3. That much closer: sports and social media.
How has social media catapulted sports culture/the sports industry, and vice versa? </h3>

<p> I am far away from home, and nobody likes the Toronto Maple Leafs here. But social media outlets like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have helped fans feel closer as a community and there’s no doubt that a huge amount of tweets, Likes and posts are sent during games and playoff seasons. I’d like to propose an infographic that uses data about the number of Twitter followers and Facebook fans of NHL teams, along with data on who watches the games, to illustrate how social media has changed the sports industry (i.e. made it grow). What I mean is, the two are now linked in interesting ways (which I may still have to flesh out). One way this could go could be a map of where fans are, and if those fans are using Twitter, Facebook to stay connected to their teams. </p>

<p> This could be newsworthy in time for the Stanley Cup playoffs in May. I’ve found data on the number of Twitter followers for NHL teams (http://www.statista.com/statistics/243070/twitter-followers-of-national-hockey-league-teams/) , and the number of Facebook fans for NHL teams in 2013 (http://www.statista.com/statistics/243087/facebook-fans-of-national-hockey-league-teams/). A human source could be a media communications researcher who would know about the rising trends and add a sociological perspective. My source would be Rhonda McEwen (http://individual.utoronto.ca/rmcewen/). </p>

<p> For this project, I would have to learn how to write codes for interactive pie charts or graphs, but I would first have to define a solid question of what I want this data, and this infographic to achieve. I would love for this infographic to appear on something like the New York Times or Quartz. </p> 

<h3> 4.  The cost of a good game? NHL or NFL concussions </h3>

<p> This is an extra idea I was also considering, though not in as much depth. Concussions in the NHL have increased over the past couple of years, despite new rules on the ice, implemented to curb those injuries. A study was published in PLOS ONE that showed how the rule, called Rule 48, didn’t hinder the concussions. The researchers created some great data on the specific types of injuries by season <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069122#s3">injuries by season</a> . It would be interesting to compare the number of brain injuries (if they are really rising in other sports as well) to data on increasing popularity of that sport. It would also be interesting to compare the number of brain injuries to the number of players aiming to play pro. Again, this was just a thought. </p>
