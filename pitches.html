<h3> #1: Expressive writing and the brain: mapping out the impact of writing </h3>

My infographic will draw on my research work at the University of Toronto on how the act of expressive writing impacts the brain. Instead of a map of the nation, it will map out the brain, with the key image of an enlarged brain, and the different regions divided into different colours. When you roll over each section, it will show a list or pie chart of all the studies conducted about that area in relation to writing (i.e. Broca’s area). A lot of the studies will be speculative however, since the work being done on writing and the brain is ongoing and not fully fleshed out. The main message of the infographic is to illustrate—creatively and hopefully beautifully—how expressive writing impacts other areas besides writing itself: it impacts math, creativity, cognitive skills, etc. 

<h3> #2: Classic or popular literature from around the world </h3>

This infographic will take a list of the most widely read classic books from around the world and illustrate their geography on a world map (alternatively, this infographic could specifically focus on American literature by state). The map could be interactive—where the user can scan through different time periods (i.e. 19th century, 20th century, post-modern), to see what was being read, or what books were causing a stir at that time, in different parts of the world. It might be interesting for the reader to compare what was popular in Japan during the 20th century wasn’t what was popular in Russia at that same time. 

<h3> #3: Bucharest Early Intervention Project </h3>

This infographic will illustrate the findings of the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, in which a group of Romanian psychologists and neurologists visited Romanian institutions and followed the children there for 12 years. After 12 years of follow-ups, they found that children who left the institution earlier (i.e. before the age of two) had different stress responses (as measured by cortisol levels) as well as varying amounts of white matter in the brain (as measured by EEG) compared to children who stayed in the orphanage longer. Children who stayed longer in institutions also had limited abilities to learn language, make cognitive decisions on tests and behave properly in social situations. The researchers, led by Charles Nelson and Nathan Fox, define the cause of this as simple neglect—or the absence of a responsive parent—and the study supports a broader field of how the environment can change the developing brain. The infographic will show these findings, perhaps in a creatively illustrated graph.
